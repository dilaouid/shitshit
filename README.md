# ShitShit

## What it's all about ?
Well, it's just some shitty cheatsheet. Multiple usefuls algorithms or functions which will help you gain some time for your software/web developement. Each directory will teach you and/or show one of those great algorithm you may need for your shitty project.

## Available algorithms:

|Languages| Haversine | Video Streaming Basic
|--|--|--|
|Typescript  | ✔️ |✔️
|Javascript| ✔️ |✔️
|Go| ❌ |❌
|PHP| ✔️ |❌
|C| ✔️ |❌
|C++| ❌ |❌
|C#| ❌ |❌
|Python| ✔️ | ❌
|Next| ☑️ | ✔️
|Express| ☑️ | ✔️
|Java| ❌ | ❌
|Pearl| ❌ | ❌
|Dart| ❌ | ❌
|Ruby| ❌ | ❌

**Algorithms:**

 - **[Haversine](https://github.com/dilaouid/shitshit/tree/main/haversine)**: formula to get the distance in meters between two positions points (**latitude** and **longitude**)
 - **[Basic Video Streaming](https://github.com/dilaouid/shitshit/tree/main/video%20streaming%20basic)**: Stop using weird video balise pointing to the video. Use the power of the stream instead, it's better and works JIT. Segment your video into chunks for a better performance. It's basic : no codecs, no adaptative, no subtitles
